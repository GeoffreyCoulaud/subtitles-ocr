# subtitles-ocr

A work-in-progress harcoded subtitles extractor

The goal is to pass as an input a video with hardcoded subtitles (hardsubs) and output a clean, ready to use, `.ass` subtitles file.
Focus is primarily on fansubbed anime, where no official subs exist, but good quality raws have appeared.
Dialogue, lyrics and "forced" in-frame translations all count as subtitles.
Original text positions should not be altered. This is a pure extraction program. 

## What is not a subtitle

- Forced text already in the source material (eg. credits, character names)
- In-scene text already in the source material (eg. signs)
- Generally, any other text not part of the subtitles
